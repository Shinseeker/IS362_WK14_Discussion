    "The easiest way to help is to double the amount of items that new users can sell over all. This would also help new users sell higher volume of items, and at the same time it would make them feel confident about the selling and the buying system. They make money and they can spend money. For example, when users can easilly find items they are looking for, as well as other items they might be interested in, they are more likely to make purchases. This makes everyone happy- both the buyers and the sellers. \n",
